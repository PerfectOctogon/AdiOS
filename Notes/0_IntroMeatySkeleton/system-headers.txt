System headers define types, constants and function prototypes needed for both kernel and user-space

There is a headers.sh script that installs these headers in the system root to prepare for compilation. 

Free standing headers (stddef.h, stdint.h) come with cross compilers but lack implementations for many functions.

headers.sh dows not compile the OS itself - it only sets up headers for later use.

A hosted GCC cross-compiler (supporting user-space) will later require these headers.
