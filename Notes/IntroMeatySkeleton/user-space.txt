The environment where applications and programs execute, separate from the kernel

It has:
    - Restricted access
    - No direct access to hardware (must go through kernel using syscalls)
    - Processes are isolated from each other (prevents one process from interfering with another)
    - Crash in user space affects only the crashed process, not the entire OS

Examples : web browsers. text editors, games etc
